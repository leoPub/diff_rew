We provide the source code implementation of the reward-differential method for the QMIX algorithm herein. Due to substantial subsequent modifications in our extended work, implementations for MADQN and MAPPO could be adapted from the repositories we provide below. For any reproduction issues, please contact leohancnjs@outlook.com.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

2. Install [Flow](https://flow-project.github.io/) to [`./flow/`](./flow/) and config SUMO binary
   
   Flow is a computational framework for deep RL and control experiments for traffic microsimulation.
   To install Flow and the compatible SUMO binary, you should follow
   [Flow Installation instructions](http://flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flow_setup.html). Make sure the test case could run.

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up algorithm parameters in [`./config.py`](./config.py)

6. Run experiment from [`./highway_exp.py`](./highway_exp.py)
